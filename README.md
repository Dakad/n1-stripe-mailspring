# N1 Stripe

Stripe modifies the layout of the Nylas N1 email client by moving the account sidebar to the bottom of the interface.

Folder use in email clients are a relatively secondary use case in my experience. It's important to for organizing and retrieving messages that you'll need down the road, but not more important than reviewing the current inbox. By moving folders to the bottom, the interface reserves the primary canvas space for messages themselves. That's the idea behind the prototype, anyway.

This may not be for you if you regularly use many folders or if you need to toggle between separate accounts a lot.  Still, try it out and let me know what you think.


## Prototype

N1 is designed with an account sidebar in mind. Moving it to the bottom is a CSS hack, which works for the most part, but is nonetheless forcing a square peg into a round hole.

Also, there are a lot of nuanced layout use cases. I addressed a bunch of them, but there were far more than I (naively) expected, so beware the thing is a "work-in-progress."
